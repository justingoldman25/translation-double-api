## Part 1: App Description

> Please provide a firendly description of your app, including the
> the primary functions available to users of the app. Be sure to
> describe exactly what APIs you are using and how they are connected
> in a meaningful way.

> **Also, include the GitHub `https` URL to your repository.**

My app's purpose is like a dictionary that you can translate. You type in your term
    and it finds the definition for your term. It then gives you an option
    to translate and a few languages to choose from if you do decide to.

## Part 2: New

> What is something new and/or exciting that you learned from working
> on this project?

I learned how to queury API's much better than before. I learned that different API's have different
    ways to contact them and some are harder and more intuitive than others.
    I also learned how to multiple the response I get back from API's much better.
    I also learned how to do a two step program where one half of the program is unavailible
    until the first half is complete.

## Part 3: Retrospect

> If you could start the project over from scratch, what do
> you think might do differently and why?

I had a lot of code that was only activated in another method. I would definitly have made more methods so
    that it was fully clear what each method is doing. I have a lot of methods that are doing jobs
    for other methods because I couldn't figure out how to make them all have one single function.
    That is something I really want to work on in the future as it made finding errors a pain in my ass
    and the last leg of the project was way harder than I wished it had been.
